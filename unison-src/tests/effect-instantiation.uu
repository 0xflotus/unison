effect Foo where

-- This version works okay, instantiates `a` to '{Foo} Text
-- blah 'Foo.foo '("hello!") 

-- This version doesn't work, it instantiates `a` to 'Text,
-- but doesn't allow that solution to `a` to be refined by later
-- arguments - end up with an ability check failure on the second arg

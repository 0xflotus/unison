ability Woot where
  woot : {Woot} Nat

wha : ((a ->{Woot} a) -> a ->{Woot} a) -> Nat
wha f =
  blah a = f' a
  f' = f blah
  42

----

The expression in red needs the {Woot} ability, but this location does not have access to any abilities.

    7 |   f' = f blah

But note `f` is underapplied and requires no abilities when called with just one argument.

# Editing a Unison codebase

The Unison codebase is not just a mutable bag of text files, it's a structured object that undergoes a series of well-typed transformations over the course of development. These well-typed transformations begin their life in a `Branch`. A `Branch` is never in a "broken" state, only incomplete, yet we can still make arbitrary edits to a codebase. This document explains what a `Codebase` and a `Branch` are and how the programmer interacts with them. The benefits of the Unison approach which we'll see are:

* Incremental compilation is perfectly precise and comes for free, regardless of what editor you use. You'll almost never spend time [waiting for Unison code to compile](https://xkcd.com/303/), _no matter how large your codebase_.
* Refactoring is a controlled experience where the refactoring always typechecks and you can precisely measure your progress, so arbitrary changes to a codebase can be completed without ever dealing with a depressingly long list of (often misleading) compile errors or broken tests!
* Codebase changes can be worked on concurrently by multiple developers, and many situations that traditionally result in incidental merge conflicts or build issues can no longer occur. (e.g., Alice swapped the order of two definitions in a file, conflicting with Bob's adding an unrelated definition.)
* Renames, even bulk renames of whole packages of definitions, are 100% accurate and fast. When it's this easy to rename things, there's less anxiety about picking names and less need to pick the perfect name at the moment you start writing something.
* We can assign multiple names to the same definitions, and you can choose which naming you prefer and publish your naming schemes for others to use if they wish. [Bikeshedding](http://bikeshed.com/) over names can be a thing of the past (or at least vastly reduced ðŸ˜€).
* Dependency hell is also vastly reduced: many situations that contribute to dependency hell simply cannot arise with the Unison codebase model.
* As an added bonus, it's no problem to use different versions of some library in different parts of your application when convenient, just as you might use two unrelated libraries in your application.
* It's easy to mix and match parts of different libraries into a custom bundle, which others can use, all while retaining full compatibility with the existing libraries that the bundle draws from.
* Publishing code is trivial; it won't require any additional steps beyond pushing to a git repository or shared filesystem. (Other filesystem-like services can be supported in the future.)
* Import statements are first-class values which can be shared and aggregated and published for consumption by others. No more project-wide import boilerplate at the top of every file!
* And this is all done in a backwards compatible way using existing tools: you can still use your favorite text editor, can still version your code with Git, use GitHub, etc.

Warning: once you experience this mode of editing a codebase and the control, safety, and ease of it, the "mutable bag of text files" model of a codebase may start to seem barbaric in comparison. ðŸ˜±

## The big idea  ðŸ§ 

Here it is: _Unison definitions are identified by content._ Therefore, there's no such thing as changing a definition, there's only introducing new definitions.  What can change is how we map definitions to human-friendly names. e.g. `x -> x + 1` (a definition) vs `Integer.increment` (a name we associate with it for the purposes of writing and reading other code that references it). An analogy: Unison definitions are like stars in the sky. We can discover new stars and create new star maps that pick different names to the stars, but the stars exist independently of what we choose to call them.

With this model, we don't ever change a definition, nor do we ever change the mapping from names to definitions (we call such mappings "namespaces"). A namespace is simply another kind of definition. Like all definitions, it is immutable. When we want to "change" a namespace, we create a new one, and _change which namespace mapping we are interested in_. This might seem limited, but it isn't at all, as we'll see.

From this simple idea of making definitions (including definitions of namespaces) immutable, we can build a better development experience around codebase editing with all of the above benefits.

## The model

This section gives the model of what a `Codebase` is, what a `Branch` is, what their API is. Later we'll cover what the actual user experience is for interacting with the model, along with various concrete usage scenarios.

The model deals with a few types, `Code`, `Codebase`, `Branch`, and `Namespace`:

* `Code` could be a function or value definition (a `Term`) or a `TypeDeclaration`. Each `Term` in the `Codebase` also includes its `Type`. A Unison codebase contains no ill-typed terms. Each `Code` also knows its `Author` and `License`, which are just terms.
* `Namespace` denotes a `Map Code Name` which assigns a unique fully-qualified `Name` to each `Code`.
* `Branch` denotes a function from `Set Code -> (Set Code, Namespace)`. It produces a new set of definitions, along with unique names for any number of these definitions. We can think of a branch as moving the codebase from one version to another.
* `Codebase` denotes a `Set Code`, a `Map Name Branch` of named "pending" branches, and a `Map Name Branch` of named "saved" branches.

At a high level, a `Branch` denotes a function from `Set Code` to `(Set Code, Namespace)`, but we use a representation that comes equipped with a commutative merge operation that allows multiple developers to collaborate on building a `Branch`. This section gives a model for that.

Here's `Codebase` and `Code` types:

```haskell
data Codebase =
  Codebase { code     : Set Code
           , branches : Map Name Branch
           , tags     : Map Name Release }

-- All code knows its dependencies, author, and license
Code.dependencies : Code -> Set Code
Code.author : Code -> Author
Code.license : Code -> License
```

A `Release` is... ?? Should have a `Namespace` (unconflicted) which is "fully propagated" as far out as the `Branch` it was created from could go.

A `Branch` denotes `Set Code -> (Set Code, Namespace)`, but represented as a mergeable data structure:

```haskell
data Branch = Branch
  { version    : Clock
  , branchId   : BranchId
  , added      : Set Code
  , edited     : Map Code (Set Edit, Clock)

  -- mergeable `Map Name (Set Code, Clock)` for tracking what names are bound to
  , namespace  : Namespace'
  , ancestors  : Map BranchId Clock }

-- Invariant: immediately merging a fork of a branch with the branch is a no-op
-- Invariant: current version should be the max of any of your edit clock values

add : Code -> Branch -> Branch
add c b = b { version = version b + 1, added = Set.add c (added b) }

fork : Branch -> Branch
fork (Branch {..}) =
  Branch (version + 1) newBranchId added edited namespace (Map.fromList [(branchId, version)])

data Release =
  Release { namespace : Namespace
          -- map from old code to new code
          , edits     : Map Code Edit
          , previous  : Release }
```

`Clock` is just a `Nat` whose merge operation adds 1 to the sum of the two clocks, as with a [Lamport clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamport_timestamps).

We'll say what `Edit` and `Namespace'` are momentarily, but the general idea is that the commutative monoid combines corresponding elements of the `Branch`. For the `Map` components of the `Branch`, in the event that the two branches talk about the same keys, we check to see if one is a later version of the other with respect to that key, by consulting `ancestors`. If so, we use the later version. If not, the changes are concurrent and we try to merge the values that collided using some monoid.

The `Edit` type denotes a function `Code -> Code`, though we represent it in a way that can be merged:

```haskell
data Edit
  = Replace Code Typing
  | Deprecated
  | SwapArguments Permutation -- optional idea for more semantic edits

data Typing = Same | Subtype | Different

data TypeEdit
  = Replace TypeDeclaration
  -- Ideas: Add Constructor Type, Remove Constructor ConstructorId
  | Deprecated
```

The `Typing` indicates whether the replacement `Code` is the same type as the old `Code`, a subtype of it, or a different type. This is useful for knowing how far we can automatically propagate a `Branch`.

The `Edit` type produces a `Conflict` when merged, though with more structured edits (*e.g.*, in the case of the `SwapArguments` data constructor), even more could be done here.

```haskell
instance Monoid Edit where
  mempty = Conflict mempty
  Conflict e `mappend` e2 | Set.null e = e2
  e `mappend` Conflict e2 | Set.null e2 = e
  Replace c t `mappend` Replace c2 _ | c == c2 = Replace c t

  SwapArguments p1 `mappend` SwapArguments p2 | Permutation.commutes p1 p2 =
    SwapArguments (Permutation.compose p1 p2)

  e `mappend` e2 = Conflict (Set.union (flat e) (flat e2)) where
    flat (Conflict e) = flat e
    flat e = Set.singleton e
```

A `Namespace'` is just a `Map Name (Set Code, Clock)`, commutatively merged in the obvious way, using the `Clock` to resolve conflicts and failing that, taking the union of colliding keys. We say a `Namespace'` is conflicted if any of its sets aren't of size 1. An unconflicted `Namespace'` can be converted to a `Namespace` in the obvious way.

A `Branch` goes through its life of being created based off some existing branch (which is added to its `ancestors` set), worked on (built up via edits and merges from one or more developers), and then merged to another branch and/or saved (for instance when creating a "release" branch).

A branch (the "source") can be merged into another branch (the "target") as long as its `Namespace'` is unconflicted and it covers all the edits of the target branch.

A branch is said to _cover_ another when it has been developed to the point that the remaining updates are type-preserving and can thus be applied automatically. More precisely, a Branch `c` covers a `cb : Codebase` when all dependents in `cb` of type-changing edits in `c` (including deprecations) also have an edit in `c`, and none of the edits are in a conflicted state.

If we want to measure how much work remains for a Branch `c` to cover a `cb : Codebase`, we can count the transitive dependents of all _escaped dependents_ of type-changing edits in `c`. An _escaped dependent_ is in `cb` but not `c`. This number will decrease monotonically as the `Branch` is developed.

_Related:_ There are some useful computations we can do to suggest which dependents of the frontier to upgrade next, based on what will make maximal progress in decreasing the remaining work. The idea is that it's useful to focus first on the "trunk" of a refactoring, which lots of code depend on, rather than the branches and leaves. Programmers sometimes try to do something like this when refactoring, but it can be difficult to know what's what when the main feedback you get from the compiler is just a big list of compile errors.

We also typically want to encourage the user to work on updates by expanding outward from initial changes, such that the set of edits form a connected dependency graph. If the user "skips over" nodes in the graph, there's a chance they'll need to redo their work, and we should notify the user about this. It's not something we need to prevent but we want the user to be aware that it's happening.

To apply a `Branch` to a `Codebase`, we interpret the `Branch` as a `Codebase -> Codebase`, in the obvious way. The new definitions added by the branch are added to the codebase and the branch itself is copied from the `ongoing` map to the `applied` map. The branch can publish whatever names it likes for its output codebase.

The `namespace` portion of a `Branch` can be built up using whatever logic the programmer wishes, including picking arbitrary new names for definitions, though very often, the names output by a `Branch` will be the same as or based on the names assigned to old versions of definitions in `ancestors`.

This is it for the model. The rest of this document focuses on how to expose this nice model for use by the Unison programmer.

## The developer experience

When writing code, a developer has full access to all code that's been written, just by using different imports.

    > branch scratch
    There's no branch named 'scratch' yet.
    Would you like me to create it and switch to it? y/n
    > y
    âœ… I've created and switched to branch 'scratch'.
       Note: `> branch` can be used to show the active branch.
    > branch
    'scratch' at version 0
    > watch foo.u
    Watching foo.u for definitions to add to 'scratch' branch...
    Noticed a change, parsing and typechecking...
    ðŸ›‘ I've found errors in 'foo.u', here's what I know:
    ...
    âœ… I've parsed and typechecked definitions in foo.u: `wrangle`
       Would you like to add this to the codebase? y/n
    > y
    âœ… It's done, using 'Alice' as author, Acme, Inc. as copyright holder,
       license is BSD3 (your chosen defaults). Use `> help license` if you'd
       like guidance on how to change any of this.
    > branch
    'scratch' at version 1
    > branch series/24
    âœ… Switched to 'series/24' branch
    > alias scratch.wrangle Acme.Alice.utils.wrangle
    âœ… I've marked a new definition 'Acme.Alice.utils.wrangle' for publication
       in 'series/24' branch.

_Question:_ what if `Acme.Alice.utils.wrangle` already exists in the 'series/24' branch? Unison reports a conflict and forces the user to pick a unique name:

    > alias scratch.wrangle Acme.Alice.utils.wrangle
    ðŸ›‘ I'm afraid there's already a definition in this branch called 'Acme.Alice.utils.wrangle'.
       You can either `> move Acme.Alice.utils.wrangle <new name>` or choose
       a different local name for `scratch.wrangle`.

Another possibility: the name already exists locally and is coincidentally bound to the exact same `Code`, in which case we get a warning:

    > alias scratch.wrangle Acme.Alice.utils.wrangle
    ðŸ”¸ There was already a definition `Acme.Alice.utils.wrangle` which was
       exactly equivalent to `scratch.wrangle`.

_Question:_ what if `scratch.wrangle` also exists in this branch? If you're using `alias`, you are always referring to another branch as the first argument. You can't alias a definition in the current branch as that would mean that a `Code` in this branch no longer had a unique name. (Alternate answer: some special syntax to disambiguate referring to another branch, like `scratch:wrangle` or `scratch/wrangle`, though if we do that, we would need to disallow that separator in branch identifiers)

_Question:_ How does Alice test that her changes actually work? She probably needs to propagate them out as far as her tests, assuming that's possible. But we obviously don't want to be recompiling and regenerating binaries on every edit. _Answer:_ The namespace of a branch refers to the latest version of everything, propagated as far as possible. Anything else has the prefix `old`. We achieve this just by keep a `Map Reference Reference` of type-compatible replacements which we then use in various places (such as the runtime) to do on-the-fly rewriting.

_Question:_ What about "third-party" dependencies? How do those fit in here? _Answer:_ These are tracked with first-class imports.

Assuming that is successful:

    > delete branch scratch
    âœ… I've deleted the 'scratch' branch.
    > git commit push
    âœ… I've committed and pushed 'series/24' updates (listed below)
       to https://github.com/acme/acme
       ...

It's not generally necessary to create a new branch every time, you can also just add definitions directly to the current base branch.

The `> branch blah` command creates a new branch with no ancestors. You can also create branches whose ancestor is the current branch, which is useful for a refactoring that you eventually want to merge back into the current branch.

    > fork major-refactoring
    âœ… I've created and switched to new branch 'major-refactoring'.
       It's a child of branch 'series/24' version 29381.
    > watch foo.u
    ...
    âœ… Added definition 'Acme.transmogrify'
    > branch series/24
    âœ… Switched to 'series/24' branch
    > merge major-refactoring
    âœ… Updated 182 definitions, no conflicts
    > save release/24
    âœ… Saved 'series/24' as branch 'release/24'

Note that a `use release/24` in your Unison code can be used to access the namespace of a branch.

### Publishing

To publish something for use by others, users just share a URL that links to their GitHub repository. There's no separate step of creating some artifact like a jar and uploading that to some third-party package repository. That URL is something like `https://acme.github.io/unison/QjdBS8sdbWdj`, where the `QjdBS8sdbWdj` is a Base 58 encoding of a particular Unison hash. The GitHub repository format for Unison doubles as a GitHub pages site so anyone can explore the repository from that point, obtaining pretty-printed and hyperlinked source code, pretty HTML documentation, and so on.

To start using someone else's published code, you can do a `get`:

    > get https://acme.github.io/unison/QjdBS8sdbWdj
    About to fetch 'https://acme.github.io/unison/release/24'.
    choose a name for the namespace (suggest 'acme'): acme

    Fetching...

    âœ… Loaded 1089 definitions into acme/release/24
       Use `> docs acme/release/24`

The URL here can point to a single definition, in which case it along with its transitive dependencies are added to the local codebase. In this case, it doesn't get a name, but you can refer to it by hash. Nameless code in the codebase probably records the URL where it was loaded from since that URL might have useful information about the hash. We might also by default look for `<url>/docs-**.link` or something to fetch documentation.

Alternately, we can juse `use` a release URL directly, as a namespace, without a `> get` happening first. Perhaps `use <any import expression> from <long url>`.  `<long url>` includes the hash of the release, which is a Unison Term including the namespace itself and references to a bunch of code. This is downloaded, along with all of its transitive dependencies. The namespace is spliced into the current parsing environment according to the import expression of the `use` statement.

Question: How do you discover new versions of hashes? (including hashes that refer to docs)

__Note:__ In the event of naming conflicts when doing a `get` (if you already have a branch with that name locally), Unison will force you to pick a different name.

## Repository format

TODO, update

A design goal of the repository format is that it can be versioned using Git (or Hg, or whatever), and there should never be merge conflicts when merging two Unison repositories. That is, Git merge conflicts are a bad UX for surfacing concurrent edits that the user may wish to reconcile.

Simple, correct implementation of `Branch` and `merge`:

```haskell
-- vector clock
newtype Clock = Clock (Map BranchId Int)

-- True if `c` definitely happened before `c2`. Assumes that clock values start
-- at 0 before the first event for any BranchId.
Clock.before : Clock -> Clock -> Bool
Clock.before (Clock c) (Clock c2) =
  all (\(k,v) -> fromMaybe 0 (Map.lookup k c2) >= v) (Map.toList c)

instance Monoid Clock where
  mempty = Clock mempty
  Clock a `mappend` Clock b = Map.unionWith max a b

data Branch = Branch
  { version     : Clock
  , branchId    : BranchId
  , edited      : Map Term (Set Edit, Clock)
  , editedTypes : Map TypeDeclaration (Set TypeEdit, Clock)
  , namespace   : Map Name (Set Code, Clock) }

merge :: Branch -> Branch -> Branch
merge b1 b2 = let
  version' = version b1 `mappend` version b2
  branchId' = branchId b1
  resolve :: Semigroup a => (a, Clock) -> (a, Clock) -> (a, Clock)
  resolve a@({edits1}, clock1) b@({edits2}, clock2)
    | Clock.before clock1 clock2 = b
    | Clock.before clock2 clock1 = a
    | otherwise                  = resolve0 a b
  -- Note: this also covers if two people make exact same edit, so no conflict
  resolve x y = resolve0 x y
  resolve0 (edits1, clock1) (edits2, clock2) = (edits1 <> edits2, version')
  edited' = Map.unionWith resolve (edited b1) (edited b2)
  editedTypes' = Map.unionWith resolve (editedTypes b1) (editedTypes b2)
  namespace' = Map.unionWith resolve (namespace b1) (namespace b2)
  in Branch version' branchId' edited' editedTypes' namespace'
```

data Branch = Branch
  { version    : Clock
  , branchId   : BranchId
  , edited     : Map Code (Set Edit, Int) // <branchid>.<int>.clock
  , namespace  : Map Name (Set Code, Int) }

-- the Int inside edited/namespace either needs originate in this branch or
-- it needs to come from a merge, in which case it can still be considered to
-- come from this branch
```

Operations on a `Branch`:

* `add` a `Name` and associated `Code` to a `Branch`.
* `rename name1 name2`, checks that `name2` is available, and if so does the rename.
* `update oldcode oldnameafter newcode newname`, check that `newname` is available, if so add it to `edited` map. `oldcode` will be referred to using some fully-qualified name. `oldnameafter` will be the name for `oldcode` after the update, just like for `deprecate`.
* `deprecate oldcode newname` marks `oldcode` for deprecation, with optional `newname`, also adds this to `edited` map.
* `empty` creates a `Branch 0 newGuid Map.empty Map.empty Map.empty`, satisfies `merge b empty ~= b` and `merge empty b ~= b`, where `~=` compares branches ignoring their `branchId`.
* `fork b == merge new-branch b`

Let's define `merge`:

```haskell
merge : Branch -> Branch -> Branch
merge b1 b2 = let
  version' = version b1 `mappend` version b2 -- + 1??
  branchId' = branchId b1
  resolve :: Semigroup a => (a, Clock) -> (a, Clock) -> (a, Clock)
  resolve a@({edits1}, clock1) b@({edits2}, clock2) =
    case Map.lookup (branchId b2) (ancestors b1) of
      -- want edit1 to win if we knew about edit2 when we created edit1
      Just clock2' | clock2' >= clock2 -> a
      _ -> case Map.lookup (branchId b1) (ancestors b2) of
        Just clock1' | clock1' >= clock1 -> b
        _ -> resolve0 a b
  -- Note: this also covers if two people make exact same edit, so no conflict
  resolve x y = resolve0 x y
  resolve0 (edits1, clock1) (edits2, clock2) = (edits1 <> edits2, version')
  edited' = Map.unionWith resolve (edited b1) (edited b2)
  namespace' = Map.unionWith resolve (namespace b1) (namespace b2)
  ancestors' = Map.unionWith max (ancestors b1) (ancestors b2) `Map.union`
               Map.fromList [(branchId b2, version')] -- ??
  in Branch version' branchId' edited' namespace' ancestors'
```

Sets are represented by directories of immutable empty files whose file names represent the elements of the set - the sets are union'd as a result of a Git merge. Deletions are handled without conflicts as well.

Likewise, maps are represented by directories with a subdirectory named by each key in the map. The content of each subdirectory represents the value for that key in the map.

Observation: we'll probably want some additional indexing structure (which won't be versioned) which can be cached on disk and derived from the primary repo format. This is useful for answering different queries on the codebase more efficiently.

## Notes and ideas

You can have first-class imports with a type like:

```haskell
type Namespace = Map Name (Set Code) -> Map Code [NameEdit]
```

There's a nice little combinator library you can write to build up `Namespace` values in various ways, and we can imagine the Unison `use` syntax to be sugar for this library.

**Arya**: I'm still thinking we'll want something like scopes to be able to apply a branch to a prefix in a "clone package foo.x to foo.y and apply these changes" sort of wway.

{-
Precedence of language constructs is identical to Haskell, except that all
operators (like +, <*>, or any sequence of non-alphanumeric characters) are
left-associative and equal precedence, and operators must have surrounding
whitespace (a + b, not a+b) to distinguish from identifiers that may contain
operator characters (like empty? or fold-left).

Sections / partial application of infix operators is not implemented.
